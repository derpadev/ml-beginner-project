# Titanic Survival Prediction (Beginner Machine Learning Project)

This project is my first end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📌 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset using Pandas
- Cleaned missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Selected relevant features
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Achieved **0.81 accuracy** on the test set

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visuals)

## 📁 Files
- `phase1.ipynb` — the full notebook with all code
- `titanic.csv` — dataset
- `README.md` — project explanation

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Try different ML models
- Add visualizations
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Move on to a larger Kaggle dataset
